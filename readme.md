<h1>Howdy!</h1>
<p> If you are reading this it is because you are looking to help either develop or maintain this site. Which cool thanks for helping! However, a couple of things to mention before you go messing with anything.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you don't know how to use git, please watch this <a href="">THIS</a> video. This will at least give you enough to know how to not break the site.</li>
    <li>Ideally, the goal of the site is to look not ancient. Please try and spend some time on the CSS to make it look good. I don't care if nothing matches, just make it look cool and good.</li>
    <li>For now the most likely place this site will go is here on Git Hub. There isn't a need to put it on an AWS Cluster if it's static. Please don't go making crazy server calls or like sign-in stuff yet, they wont work.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>With that said, here is the details for the site</h2>
If you are gonna make a new change please make a new branch and not push straight to main. Best practice is to name the branch the name of the feature that you are trying to push. Something like `footer-branch` is a good one. If not, name it your name `<your name>dev-branch` or something similar.

<p>There is at least 4 pages: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Home & Rush</li>
    <li>Actives & Alumni Pictures</li>
    <li>Hisotry, FAQ, & Alumni Companies</li>
    <li>Contact Us & Social Tree</li>
</ul>
<p>'Home' is a little to barron to just be a '3 pillars', our chapter, and purpose. Condensing it would be a good way to fill room. 
<p>The actives/alumni pictures I was cooking something 
    (and still am, I was just inspired in other places first) but if you have a better idea cool. If you wanna help me, check out my eboard photo once you have the project open on your side.</p>
    <p>History and Contact is barron. Feel free to do whatever styles you want there.</p>
<h2>What needs to be done:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 of the pages</li>
    <li>Footer</li>
    <li>Ensuring that the navbar is everywhere.</li>
    <li>Having someone check to see if the information is correct.</li>
    <li>We will be using github pages for static site hosting. Domain will be tied in later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone update the list when you complete the feature. Also, use it to add more stuff to the list as needed.</p>
## What is done:
* The navigation bar is complete, it just needs to be transferred to the other pages.
* The home page is actively being worked on and will be completed before the first day of school.
